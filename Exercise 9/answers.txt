Question 1: What was the application ID you saw in the YARN frontend (http://localhost:8088) of the job where you actually ran the first_spark.py on the cluster? (It should be like application_0000000000000_0000. If you rand multiple time, pick any one.) 
Answer 1: My application Id is : application_1625243356684_0619
