Question 1. In the A/B test analysis, do you feel like we're p-hacking? How comfortable are you coming to a conclusion at p<0.05?
Answer 1. Yes, In the A/B test analysis we are p-hacking when we calculate the p value for instructors only. When odd and even uid user searches were calculated they were p>0.05 but then the data is manipulated for instructors only and the p-value for ANOVA testing is approximately equal to 0.05 but for Mann Whitney U-test the p-value is < 0.05 so yes, we are p-hacking. I dont think there was any need to manipulate the data just for the sake of p-value < 0.05 because we are ignoring a large part of data as discussed in Bad thing part of Hacking p-value in lecture notes. 


Question 2. If we had done T-tests between each pair of sorting implementation results, how many tests would we run? If we looked for p<0.05 in them, what would the probability be of having any false conclusions, just by chance? That's the effective p-value of the many-T-tests analysis. [We could have done a Bonferroni correction when doing multiple T-tests, which is a fancy way of saying “for m tests, look for significance at α/m”.]
Answer 2. There are total 7 sorting algorithms and each and every one is paired with the others for the T-test, i.e, 7*6 = 42 but this overcounts the tests by a factor of 2 so 42/2 = 21 tests should be run if T-tests between each pair of sorting implementation was performed. The probability of false conclusions, just by chance can be calculated by 1 - incorrect rejection(0.95)^21 = 1-0.3406 = 0.6594 = 0.66, hence there is a 66% probability of having any false conclusions. 


Question 3. Give a ranking of the sorting implementations by speed, including which ones could not be distinguished. (i.e. which pairs could our experiment not conclude had different running times?)
Answer 3. Ranking of sorting implementations by speed: partition_sort > qs1 > qs4 > qs5 > qs2 > qs3 > merge1. (via post_hoc.plot_simultaneous())
The indistinguishable pairs: (merge1, qs3), (qs2, qs3), (qs4, qs5) (as noted by the latest random data calculated)
