Question 1: When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?
Answer 1: When smoothing the CPU temperature, LOESS smoothing produces more smooth curve than Kalman smoothing but Kalman smoothing got a better result because of the fact that we had more information on what might have caused the noise and more accurate predicted curve than LOESS which was far too smooth. The difference was that LOESS missed the data due to other factors such as cpu_percent, sys_load_1, and fan_rpm and only produced the curve based on temperature whereas Kalman took into account the other factors, which results into a good prediction of true data.


Question 2: In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude? [Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude by the app: they don't really add much new information.]
Answer 2: Other data such as time stamp, course, and speed might come handy into predicting better results. The time stamp can provide the time difference between the latitudes and longitudes which along with direction(course) and speed between the points would help average out the distance and we would know which is noise and which was the actual distance covered. For example, if the curve shows a zig zag path then with the help of course(direction) it would be estimated that whether that path was actually travelled or it was just noise.
