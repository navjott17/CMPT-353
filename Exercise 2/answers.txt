Question 1: In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? What is the type, and describe the values.

Answer 1: As described in the code by line "data['prediction'] = data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept", the result of this calculation is the predicted value of ratings of the dog rate data. 
The type of this calculation is float64.
The values timestamp, slope and intercept are used to plot the linear line (y = m*x + c), where y = prediction, m = slope, x = timestamp, c = intercept (slope and intercept are calculated using linregress) for a best fit line. (m)fit.slope = 3.515929974847721e-08 and (c)fit.intercept = -40.46415480898916. The plot data['created_at'] vs data['prediction'] gives a linear line using the above discussed values. 


Question 2: In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?

Answer 2: This produce a fit line on the graph because prediction is calculated using a line equation: y = m*x + c, where x = data['timestamp'], which is a timestamped value of the date given in the .csv file via column data['created_at'].
The created_at and timestamp values are paired correctly to make points on the plot because they are related as timestamp value is calculated from the created_at value and then used to calculate prediction which in turn gives a best fit line plot.
